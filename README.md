# TutorialGame

1. Link to tutorial.
  This is a tutorial series by Brackeys and it consists of 10 videos. Here is the link of the first video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik
 
2. Why You picked this tutorial?
    I like fast-paced racing games such as Race the Sun or Breakneck, so I  wanted to learn how to create this kind of games.

3. What was hard part?
    The parts I did with the help of tutorial was not hard, but the coding parts were sometimes hard to follow, because there were some things I couldn't understand yet. Another hard part was adding the bonus feature (coin collection), first I tried to make it without any help but couldn't succeed, so I got help from other tutorials.
    
4. What did you learn from it?
    I learned lots of things. To be more specific, I learned:
    - Why using prefabs is important
    - Sphere Collider must be used and Box Collider must be removed in order to create a realistic sphere movement
    - How to create a stabilized third-person camera
    - What is Time.deltaTime and why it is used (It is the amount of seconds it took for the engine to process the previous frame and it         is used to make objects move equal distances regardless of computer process speed.)
    - How tags can be used and why it is convenient to use them
    - How to add levels to the game
    - How to create UI within Unity
    - How to add collectables and count the score
    - How to animate objects and screens
    
5. What new did you added to game? (bonus)
    I added three new things:
      1. Play again button at the end
      2. Coin collection feature and counting collected coins
      3. Animating coins (rotation)
